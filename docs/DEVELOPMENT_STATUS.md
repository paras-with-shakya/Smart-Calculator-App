# Development Status

> **The most important file for context recovery.** Rewrite it to the current truth at the end of every meaningful session, following the Session Handoff Protocol in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). Every claim here must be backed by code, by Git, or by a command that was actually run.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-28, at the end of the Phase 3 session.

## At a Glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Where are we? | **Phase 3 (Basic calculator) is implemented and awaits the user's review.** Phases 0–2 are complete. |
| What exists in code? | The foundation, the design system, the calculation engine (`packages/calc_engine`), and a working basic calculator: display, keypad, memory, region number format, keyboard, portrait and landscape. Other modes still show an empty state. |
| What is being worked on? | Nothing. The Phase 3 report is with the user. |
| What happens next? | The user reviews Phase 3. After their approval (and only then) comes Phase 4, history and saved calculations. |
| Git? | `main` is 6 commits ahead of `origin/main` (the user's GitHub remote) after this session's docs commit. **Claude never pushes; the user pushes themselves.** |
| What must not be repeated? | See "Do NOT Repeat" |
| Known issues? | See "Known Issues" |
| Pending decisions? | P-5, the rest of P-6 (Phase 5), P-7, P-9, P-10 |

## Current Phase

**Phase 3 (Basic calculator): implemented on 2026-09-28, awaiting the user's review.**

- The user approved Phase 2's design and Phase 3 on 2026-09-28 ("phase 2 approv and start phase 3").
- Their decisions: smart percent (DEC-036) and number formatting that follows the phone's region (DEC-037).
- **Phase 4 must not start without the user's explicit approval.**

## Completed Work

### Phases 0–2 (2026-09-28)

- **Phase 0:** the audit, the validation and the approved architecture (DEC-001 to DEC-017).
- **Project-memory system** (`813533e`).
- **Phase 1** (`06c0a93`, `7926920`, docs `01f120a`): Git, app identity, dependencies, strict lints, the workspace and engine skeleton, startup, Riverpod, typed navigation, the adaptive shell, the theme choice, preferences, database v1 and l10n.
- **Phase 2** (`0fc15ef`, `950493b`): Manrope with verified `tnum` (DEC-028); tokens and four palettes (DEC-029); `AppTheme`; the reusable components (DEC-030, DEC-035); the gallery (DEC-032); the design review (DEC-033). It was tested on the user's phone, and the user signed off the design.
- Details: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §1.1–1.11.

### Phase 3: Basic calculator (2026-09-28, this session)

Details: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §1.12 (engine) and §1.13 (calculator); decisions DEC-036 to DEC-043.

- **Module 1, the engine** (`4fec0b6`):
  - an exact `CalcValue` on `rational` (DEC-038)
  - lexer → parser → evaluator, with smart percent and implied multiplication
  - typed errors, and the limits: overflow at 10¹⁰⁰, 100 nested brackets, 1000 tokens (DEC-039)
  - 260 tests
- **Module 2, the logic** (`57a1e73`):
  - `ExpressionBuffer`, with its input rules and exact value units (DEC-040)
  - `CalculatorNotifier`
  - `MemoryNotifier` and `PreferencesMemoryRepository`
  - `LocalizedNumberFormat` and `numberFormatProvider` (DEC-037)
  - 228 tests
- **Module 3, the screen** (`85c6c84`):
  - `CalculatorView`, with layouts and keyboard support (DEC-042)
  - `CalculatorDisplay`, `CalculatorKeypad`, `CalculatorMemoryKeys` and `CalculatorDisplayFormatter`
  - the new components `DisplayText` and `CalculatorButtonKind.memory` (DEC-043), both in the gallery
  - 37 strings
  - the shell's short-window rule (DEC-042)
- **Review:**
  - 50 design-review screenshots generated and reviewed by Claude. Two fixes: line breaks inside numbers, and the tablet-landscape keypad alignment.
  - Tested on the user's phone. Two more fixes: landscape keys under 48 dp, and the memory badge's screen-reader label (see below).
- **Not built, by decision:**
  - the engine's function registry (no functions until Phase 5; ROADMAP updated)
  - the roadmap's "more" menu, which would be empty (DEC-041)

### Test on the user's phone (2026-09-28, this session)

The phone was connected by USB, as it was for the Phase 2 test at the user's request.

- **Device:** `23124RN87I`, Android 15, 360×800 dp, region en-IN, dark system theme.
- **Method:** the release APK installed with `adb install -r`; taps with `adb shell input`; the UI read through `uiautomator dump`; screenshots with `screencap`.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Keys | All 25 keys exposed with their names ("Divide", "Memory store", …); about 76×75 dp in portrait |
| `1234567×8+90` | Shows `12,34,567×8+90` with the preview `98,76,626`; `=` shows the result `98,76,626` under the expression |
| Smart percent | `50+10%` previews 55 |
| Memory | MS, then `2×` MR shows `2×98,76,626` (preview `1,97,53,252`); the "M 98,76,626" badge shows |
| Error | `5÷0=` shows "Can't divide by zero" under the expression |
| Restart | After a force-stop and relaunch, the memory is still there |
| Landscape | The keypad is beside the display. **Found:** keys 47.6 dp tall. **Found:** the memory badge's label covered the whole screen. Both fixed, re-installed and re-checked: keys 49 dp, badge label on its own small node. |
| Hold ⌫ | Clears the display to 0 |
| Screen reader text | The expression reads as "1 plus 2" |

- **Phone settings:** only the rotation was changed (for landscape), and it was restored: auto-rotate off, rotation 0. Font scale 1.0 and locale en-IN were not touched. The screenshots on the phone were deleted after pulling them.

## Work In Progress

None.

## Current Task

The user reviews Phase 3.

- **Screenshots:** `build/design_review/calc_*.png` (15 calculator screens) and `gallery_display_*.png`. They are local only, not committed.
- **On the phone:** the release build of this session is installed.

## Next Task

1. **If the user asks for changes to Phase 3:** make them, re-run the checks, regenerate and review the screenshots, and update the docs.
2. **After the user approves Phase 3 and explicitly approves Phase 4:** do Phase 4, history and saved calculations (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).
   - First, confirm the v1 table columns (DEC-023).
   - Each `=` result becomes a history item (expression, result, time, mode).

## Do NOT Repeat

- Don't redo the Phase 0 validation, the Phase 1 setup or the Phase 2 design system.
- **Don't re-check Manrope's `tnum` support** (verified, DEC-028).
- **Don't add `decimal` to the engine** (DEC-038). Don't bump `test` to 1.32 in the engine: it needs a newer `test_api` than the Flutter SDK pins.
- **Don't re-add `PlaceholderView`** or restyle widgets inline. Use the components (DEC-034).
- **Don't commit `build/design_review/`** images (DEC-033).
- Don't run `dart format .`; use `dart format lib test packages`.
- Don't remove `kotlin.incremental=false` (DEC-027) unless P-10 is resolved.
- Treat the first `flutter pub get` failure after a plugin change as expected (P-9) and run it again.
- Don't set up an emulator. Don't delete platform folders. **Never push**: the user pushes their code to GitHub themselves (CLAUDE.md rule 10).
- **Don't start Phase 4** without the user's explicit approval.

## Pending Decisions

| ID | Decision | Needed by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P-5** | iOS verification: does the user have access to a Mac? | Before any iOS claim | iOS was not built (Windows) |
| **P-6** | The rest of the engine defaults: `−3²`, `2^3^2`, `0^0`, `(−8)^(1/3)`, `tan 90°` | Before Phase 5 | Percent is settled (DEC-036). See [PROJECT_MEMORY.md](PROJECT_MEMORY.md#calculation-correctness-principles). |
| **P-7** | App version source for the About screen | Phase 10 | `package_info_plus` or a build-time constant |
| **P-9** | Windows Developer Mode, or accept the one-time `pub get` failure after plugin changes | Whenever convenient | Symlinks for the kept desktop folders |
| **P-10** | Keep `kotlin.incremental=false`, or put the project and the pub cache on one drive | Optional | DEC-027 |

**Open to the user's review** (adopted by Claude during Phase 3): DEC-038 to DEC-043. The ones the user is most likely to have a view on:

- implied multiplication has the same precedence as `×`, so `6÷2(1+2)` = 9 (DEC-039)
- the memory row is always visible, and there is no "more" menu (DEC-041)
- no history panel on phones in landscape (DEC-042)

**Device testing.** The user's phone (`23124RN87I`) is used when it is connected and a test is natural or requested. Restore any phone setting a test changes.

**Resolved this session:**

- P-11 (the Phase 2 design sign-off): approved by the user.
- P-6, percent part: DEC-036.

## Tests

These checks were run this session, in `smart_calculator/`:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `dart test` (in `packages/calc_engine`, final) | `+260: All tests passed!` |
| Engine mutation checks (Module 1) | Plain percent: 13 failures. Truncating instead of rounding: 10 failures. Both restored. |
| Mutation checks on the Module 2 tests (6 mutations, each restored and verified by hash) | Each caught: leading-zero rule, closing-bracket rule, bracketed variables, incomplete-error mapping, rejected-key handling, Indian grouping |
| Landscape regression test with the old padding | **Failed**, as it should; passes with the fix |
| `flutter test` (final) | `+404 ~1: All tests passed!`; the 1 skip is the design-review generator |
| `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test packages` (final) | `Formatted 104 files (0 changed)`, exit 0 |
| `flutter analyze` (final) | `No issues found!` |
| `flutter test --tags design-review --run-skipped --update-goldens` | `+50: All tests passed!`; 50 PNGs in `build/design_review/`, reviewed |
| `flutter build apk --debug` | **Built**, 85.9 s |
| `flutter build apk --release` (final) | **Built**, 46.6 MB |
| `aapt dump badging` on the release APK | package `com.parasshakya.smartcalculator`, label "Smart Calculator"; **no INTERNET permission** (the only permission is AndroidX's `DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION`) |
| On the user's phone | See "Test on the user's phone" |

**Where the tests are:**

| Area | Tests |
| --- | --- |
| Engine (`packages/calc_engine`) | 260 |
| Expression buffer | 138 |
| Calculator notifier and memory | 59 |
| Number format | 33 |
| Calculator screen | 24 |
| Display formatter | 18 |
| `DisplayText` | 12 |
| Gallery accessibility (10 sections × 4 themes) | 40 |
| Earlier app tests (Phases 1–2), including 2 new `CalculatorButton` tests, 1 new app test and 1 new shell test | 80 |
| **App total** (`flutter test`) | **404** |

**Not run:**

- the iOS build (Windows)
- an emulator (the user doesn't want one; the app was tested on the user's phone)
- integration tests (none yet)

## Known Issues

1. **P-9:** the first `flutter pub get` after a plugin change fails once on this machine (no symlink permission). Run it again.
2. **DEC-027:** Kotlin incremental compilation is disabled (drives `C:`/`D:`).
3. **`dart format .`** crashes on long paths inside `build/`. Use `dart format lib test packages`.
4. **Release signing:** release APKs are signed with the debug key. Not scheduled.
5. **Template leftovers:** web and desktop identifiers, the web manifest and `index.html` text, `README.md`, and the default launcher icons (Phase 11).
6. **Icons don't grow with text size,** which matches Android's behaviour. To review in Phase 11.
7. **High contrast follows only the platform setting.** The in-app switch is Phase 10.
8. **The current mode isn't persisted** (DEC-021).
9. **Only checked on one device:** one phone (Android 15, 360 dp), plus test-rendered screenshots. No tablet or iOS device yet.
10. **`appDatabaseProvider` has no consumers yet** (Phase 4).
11. **Calculator limitations (Phase 3):**
    - **Editing in the middle** can build an expression the input rules can't prevent, such as `5×+3` (typing `×` before an existing `+`). `=` then shows "Invalid expression", and the expression stays editable.
    - **Two values next to each other:** deleting the `×` between two inserted values (results or memory) leaves them adjacent. They still multiply, but on screen they read as one number. This needs cursor editing to happen.
    - **The region format is read at startup.** A region change applies after the app restarts.
    - **Paste** works only through a hardware keyboard (Ctrl+V). There is no touch copy or paste menu yet.
    - **Haptics are always on.** There is no setting until Phase 10.
12. **Review findings, not changed (awaiting the user's decision):**
    - The high-contrast outline expression is repeated in 3 places (the theme, `AppCard`, `CalculatorButton`); it could become one `AppColors` getter.
    - `AppTextField` passes through parameters that nothing uses yet.
    - `AppTextField`, `AppDialog`, `ErrorState` and `LoadingState` are used only by the gallery and tests until Phases 4–7.

## Blockers

- **Phase 4:** needs the user's review of Phase 3 and explicit approval.
- **No technical blockers.** iOS still can't be built on Windows.

## Discrepancies Found

1. **Project-memory session:** the auto-memory had gone stale, and an example status template had been mistaken for real status. Both resolved.
2. **Phase 1:** DEC-015's "released within the past year" claim was wrong for `path`; the claim that Android builds pass held only on the `C:` drive (DEC-027); the docs listed `dart format .` as the QA command. All corrected.
3. **Phase 2:** the component list differs from the master prompt's by design (DEC-030). The docs said "no remote", but the user had added `origin` and pushed; corrected (CLAUDE.md rule 10, DEC-006).
4. **Phase 3:**
   - **ROADMAP.md** showed Phase 2 as COMPLETED in its sequence, but its section was still under "In Progress" (the start-of-Phase-3 update had missed it). Moved to "Completed".
   - **DEC-021** pointed to ARCHITECTURE.md §1.13 for adding pages; that section is now §1.16. Corrected.
   - **Deviations from the plan, recorded rather than silent:** no `decimal` (DEC-038); no function registry and no "more" menu (ROADMAP Phase 3 table, DEC-041).

## Last Session Summary

**2026-09-28, Phase 3 session.**

1. The user approved the Phase 2 design and Phase 3. They chose smart percent (DEC-036) and the region number format (DEC-037).
2. **Module 1, the engine:**
   - re-verified and added `rational` and `test`
   - built it test-first: 224 table cases, a fuzz test and `CalcValue` tests, 260 in all, plus two mutation checks
   - committed as `4fec0b6`
3. **Module 2, the logic:**
   - the expression buffer, the notifier, memory and the region number format
   - while reviewing it, fixed ambiguous displays: values next to numbers, and leading zeros at the cursor
   - 228 tests and 6 mutation checks
   - committed as `57a1e73`
4. **Module 3, the screen:**
   - the view, the display, the keypad, the memory row and keyboard support
   - the new components `DisplayText` and the memory key kind
   - the shell's short-window rule
   - 15 calculator screenshots reviewed, with 2 fixes
   - committed as `85c6c84`
5. **On the user's phone:** the main flows pass. Two issues were found in landscape (keys under 48 dp, and the badge's screen-reader label). Both were fixed, covered by tests, and re-checked on the phone. The rotation setting was restored.
6. **Final checks:** analyze clean, formatting clean, 404 app tests and 260 engine tests pass, 50 screenshots, and the debug and release APKs build.
7. **Docs:** DEC-038 to DEC-043 recorded; ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG, PROJECT_MEMORY and CLAUDE.md updated.

## Instructions For Next Session

1. Follow the Context Recovery Protocol in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). **Reply to the user in Hinglish** (CLAUDE.md rule 13).
2. **If the user hasn't reviewed Phase 3 yet,** ask for the review. Apply any changes through the components and tokens, then re-run the checks and regenerate the screenshots.
3. **Don't start Phase 4** until the user explicitly approves it. Then confirm the history table columns first (DEC-023).
4. **Build every new screen only from `lib/core/widgets/` and the tokens** (rule 12, DEC-034).
5. **Checks:**
   - `flutter analyze`
   - `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test packages`
   - `flutter test`
   - `dart test` in `packages/calc_engine`
   - `flutter build apk --debug`
   - after visual changes, the screenshots

   Record the actual results.
6. Finish with the Session Handoff Protocol.
